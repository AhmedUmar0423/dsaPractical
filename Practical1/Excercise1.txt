Write a sample algorithm for a navigation system.
    Input : user location and destination location
    Definiteness : Finding all possible routes to the destination
    Definitiness : Calculating the most efficent route based on traffic conditions
    Output : all the possible routes with the most efficent route highlighted
    Output : showing the time to reach the destination based on the speed of travelling
    Effectiveness : Re routing the route when alternative route taken or any other issue in route
    Finiteness : Stop once the destination is reached


Write an algorithm to find the maximum of three numbers.
    Input : 3 numbers (a, b, c)
    Finitness/ Effectivness / Definitness : compare, if a > b & a > c
        Output : maximum number is a
    Finitness/ Effectivness / Definitness : compare, if b > a & b > c
        Output : maximum number is b
    Finitness/ Effectivness / Definitness : compare, if c > a & c > b
        Output : maximum number is c
    end

Write an algorithm to find the average of a list of N numbers.
    Input : initialize sum = 0
    start loop
        Input : a number
        Effectivness : add number to sum
        Definitness : continue while N inputs taken
    Input / Effectivness : initialize average = sum / N
    Output : average
